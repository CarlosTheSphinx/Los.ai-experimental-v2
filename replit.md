# Loan Pricing White-Label Tool

## Overview

This is a white-label loan pricing application for Sphinx Capital that allows sales representatives to input loan details through a clean interface. The system automates form submission to an external pricing provider using Apify's Puppeteer scraper, returning interest rates without exposing the provider's website to end users.

The application consists of a React frontend for loan data entry, an Express backend that orchestrates pricing requests, and PostgreSQL for persisting quotes and request logs.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Routing**: Wouter (lightweight router)
- **State Management**: TanStack React Query for server state
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui component library (New York style)
- **Animations**: Framer Motion for page transitions
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Build Tool**: Vite

The frontend uses a left sidebar navigation (Shadcn Sidebar) with four main pages:
1. New Quote (/) - Loan pricing form with real-time LTV/DSCR calculations
2. Saved Quotes (/quotes) - View and manage saved pricing quotes with document status tracking
3. Agreements (/agreements) - Comprehensive agreement management with:
   - Filter tabs (All, Drafts, Sent, In Progress, Completed, Voided)
   - Search functionality
   - Actions dropdown (Resend, Remind, Edit & Resend, Void, Delete)
   - Click-through to agreement detail page

4. Agreement Detail (/agreements/:id) - Full document view with:
   - PDF viewer with page navigation and zoom
   - Field overlays showing signature positions
   - Signers panel with status and resend options
   - Document timeline (created, sent, completed, voided)
   - Actions (Resend All, Send Reminder, Void Document)

5. Projects (/projects) - Loan closing progress management with:
   - Project cards with progress bars and task counts
   - Filter tabs (All, Active, On Hold, Completed)
   - Search by project number, name, borrower, or address
   - New Project button for manual project creation

6. Project Detail (/projects/:id) - Full project management with:
   - Progress tracker showing 9-stage loan closing process
   - Task checklist organized by stage with priority badges
   - Activity timeline
   - Documents tab
   - Loan details (amount, rate, term, property info)
   - Borrower portal link sharing
   - Push to external LOS integration

7. Borrower Portal (/portal/:token) - Public portal for borrowers:
   - Token-based access (no login required)
   - Read-only view of loan progress and tasks
   - Only shows borrower-visible stages and tasks
   - Activity updates visible to borrowers

The signing page (/sign/:token) and borrower portal (/portal/:token) are rendered outside the sidebar layout for a focused experience.

### Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **Database ORM**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL
- **API Pattern**: REST endpoints defined in `shared/routes.ts`
- **Validation**: Zod schemas shared between frontend and backend
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens in httpOnly cookies with bcrypt password hashing

Key backend files:
- `server/routes.ts` - API endpoint handlers
- `server/storage.ts` - Database operations via Drizzle
- `server/db.ts` - Database connection setup
- `server/auth.ts` - Authentication utilities (password hashing, JWT generation/verification)
- `server/email.ts` - Email service for password reset notifications

### Authentication System
Multi-tenant authentication with complete data isolation:
- **Password Security**: bcrypt with 10 salt rounds
- **Session Management**: JWT tokens in httpOnly cookies with 7-day expiration
- **Cookie Settings**: secure=true in production, sameSite='lax'

### External Automation
The core pricing functionality uses Apify's Puppeteer Scraper actor to:
1. Navigate to the pricing provider's website
2. Fill in loan form fields programmatically
3. Extract the resulting interest rate
4. Return results to the frontend

### Data Flow
1. User fills loan form on frontend
2. Form data validated with Zod schema
3. Backend triggers Apify actor with loan parameters
4. Puppeteer script fills external form and scrapes result
5. Interest rate returned to user
6. User can save quote with customer details and commission calculations

### Database Schema
Tables defined in `shared/schema.ts`:
- `users` - User accounts with authentication fields (email, passwordHash, fullName, passwordResetToken)
- `pricing_requests` - Logs all pricing API requests with status
- `saved_quotes` - Stores saved quotes with customer info, loan data, and commission calculations (user_id foreign key)
- `documents` - E-signature documents with status tracking (draft/sent/in_progress/completed/voided) (user_id foreign key)
  - Fields: sentAt, completedAt, voidedAt, voidedReason for timeline tracking
- `signers` - Document signers with email, token, status, and lastReminderSent
- `document_fields` - Signature/form fields positioned on document pages
- `audit_logs` - Tracks all document actions for compliance

**Projects System Tables:**
- `projects` - Loan closing projects with borrower info, loan details, progress tracking
  - Links to source document via sourceDocumentId
  - Unique project number format: PRJ-YYYY-####
  - borrowerPortalToken for public access
  - externalSyncStatus for LOS integration
- `project_stages` - 9-stage loan closing process per project
  - Stages: documentation, underwriting, appraisal, title_review, insurance, conditions, closing_prep, funding, post_closing
  - status: pending, in_progress, completed, skipped
- `project_tasks` - Individual tasks within stages
  - Types: document_upload, review, approval, collection, scheduling, verification
  - Priorities: critical, high, medium, low
  - visibleToBorrower and borrowerActionRequired flags
- `project_activity` - Timeline of project events
  - visibleToBorrower flag for borrower portal filtering
- `project_documents` - Documents uploaded to projects
- `project_webhooks` - Webhook integration logs for n8n and external LOS

**Auto-Project Creation:**
When an agreement is fully signed, a project is automatically created with:
- 9 stages and all associated tasks from template
- Loan data populated from linked quote (if available)
- Borrower portal enabled by default

Note: `saved_quotes`, `documents`, and `projects` have `user_id` foreign keys with CASCADE delete to ensure data isolation.
